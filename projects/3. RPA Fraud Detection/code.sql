-- Start by getting a feel for the transaction_data table:

SELECT
  *
FROM
  transaction_data
LIMIT 10;

-- 2
-- The finance department noted that some of the fraudulent transactions were recorded as coming from Smokey Bear’s zip code (20252).
-- You agree this is suspicious, it’s unlikely that the fire prevention mascot is using Reputable Company’s services.
-- Find the full_names and emails of the transactions listing 20252 as the zip code.

SELECT
  full_name,
  email
FROM
  transaction_data
WHERE
  zip = 20252;

-- 3
-- Finance has also noticed a number of pseudonyms associated with fraudulent transactions.
-- The fraudsters thought it would be funny to use ‘Art Vandelay’ for their full name or add a ‘der’ for their middle name.
-- Use a query to find the names and emails associated with these transactions.

SELECT
  *
FROM
  transaction_data
WHERE
  full_name = "Art der Vandelay" OR
  full_name LIKE "% der %";

-- 4
-- There are some irregularities in the IP addresses where transactions are originating from.
-- For example, any IP address beginning with ‘10.’ is reserved for internal use.
-- We shouldn’t see IP addresses like this accessing Reputable Company’s service.
-- Find the ip_addresses and emails listed with these transactions.

SELECT
  ip_address,
  email
FROM
  transaction_data
WHERE
  ip_address LIKE "10.%";

-- 5
-- Users are making fraudulent transactions using a temporary email address service. These services provide a short-lived email that can be verified and then self-destructs.
-- Find the emails in transaction_data with ‘temp_email.com’ as a domain.

SELECT
  email
FROM
  transaction_data
WHERE
  email LIKE "%temp_email.com";

-- 6
-- The finance department is looking for a specific transaction. They know that the transaction occurred from an ip address starting with ‘120.’ and their full name starts with ‘John’.
-- Can you find the transaction?

SELECT
  *
FROM
  transaction_data
WHERE
  ip_address LIKE "120.%" AND
  full_name LIKE "John%";
